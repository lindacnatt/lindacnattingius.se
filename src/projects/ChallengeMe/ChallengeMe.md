## Project
Challenge Me is an app for challenging your skater friends to bust a trick at specific locations. Once you have added a challenge, your friends can find them on the map and take on the challenge. This App was built using React Native and Firebase for the back-end and log in possibilities. 

## Challenge
The aim of the project was to explore mobile development and creating a interactive application for a specific target group. Having a few old skaters in the development team made the project engaging and helped to really understand the potential target group.

## Results 
The result is an App for the community of skaters that lets them create and invite each other to complete diffrent challenges. The users can anywhere on the map mark a location and create their own challenge with a description and an estimated difficulty. The challenge will then be available on the map for all the other users to see and attempt to complete. If you attempt a challenge you can then share with your friends if you "Made it" or "Railed it" to confirm if you completed the challenge. It is also possible to attach a video as proof and show off your skills ;)
