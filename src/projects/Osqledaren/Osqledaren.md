## Project
Osqledaren is a magazine the belongs to and reports news about the Royal Institute of Technology. The content of the magazine revolves mainly around technological reserach, student life, and opportunities after graduation. The magazine is released 4 times a year and around 10 000 copies are printed by each release. 
## Challenge
When the visual design of the magazine of Osqledaren was updated in 2019, the webpage of Osqledaren needed a update as well. The objective of the new design was to make it more similar to the design of the magazine, make it more efficient to search through the different categories and make the articles more appealing and bring more traffic to the page. Besides the design, the webpage also was migrated from **Angular** to **React** with **Typescript** and **Gatsby**.
## My role
As this application was created by a small team of 3 people, we all had several roles. My roles were:
1. **UX/UI designer** - This was my main role in the team. My collegue and I first evaluated the design of the paper magazine to find the most important aspects that would make Osqledaren's design consistent. We then did **lean prototyping** before creating a high fidelity prototype in **Adobe XD**. 
1. **Developer** - Where I worked mostly on the category-bar which filters the articles on the first page based on the chosen category

## Results
The results are a new webpage with a fresh design that has a similar look as the magazine. The ability of adding new articles to the website has also been facilitated and the code is written so that every new generation of the editorial staff can update the webpage in the future.
