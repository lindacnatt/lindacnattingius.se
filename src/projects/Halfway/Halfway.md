## Project
Halfway propose the development of technology for easy spontaneous physical meetings through the creation of the native iOS application. Halfway lets users, in a swift and easy manner, calculate the half-way point between themselves and a friend and enables temporary location sharing in secure navigation-sessions. These sessions feature real-time location updates for both parties as well as GPS navigation to a shared half-way point. 

## Challenge
The challenge was to create an innovative map-based application that fills the need of social meetings during social distancing
## Process
Using **Etnographic studies** insights on how people behave in situations of planning a date with friends inspired the the functionality of the application. A high fidelity prototype was created in **Figma** and was usability tested before developed using Swift.
## Results
A finalized application, that soon will be available on Testflight.
## Insights
This is a MVP version of this application and further developemnt would inquire support for other transportation than walking, such as cycling.
