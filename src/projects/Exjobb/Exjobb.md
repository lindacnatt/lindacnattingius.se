## Project
This project was concucted together the digital agency **Isotop** that needed further investigation of the need and worth of using different kinds of animations in their web and mobile applications. The thesis examines the strenghts and weaknesses in terms of usability and visual appeal of the animation type *transitions* when it is used in mobile interfaces. The thesis handles questions of the balance of when an animation is considered fun and appealing and when they are distracting and affect the usability negatively.
