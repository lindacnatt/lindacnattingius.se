## Project
Halfway propose the development of technology for easy spontaneous physical meetings through the creation of the native iOS application. Halfway lets users, in a swift and easy manner, calculate the half-way point between themselves and a friend and enables temporary location sharing in secure navigation-sessions. These sessions feature real-time location updates for both parties as well as GPS navigation to a shared half-way point. 

## Challenge
The challenge was to create an innovative map-based application that fills the need of social meetings during social distancing.
## Process
Using **Etnographic studies** insights on how people behave in situations of planning a date with friends inspired the the functionality of the application. A high fidelity prototype was created in **Figma** and was **usability tested** before developed using Swift. The finalized version of the application was also usability tested and gave insights of the need of this kind of application and also that the aspects of simplicity and micro-interactions enhanced the user experience. 
## Results
A finalized application, that soon will be available on Testflight.
